= Other licenses and contributions = 

*Many of the functions of the kit are based on software developed over the years by members and collaborators of the BIC and most notably fMRIstat developed by the late [http://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/ Keith Worsley] and NIAKified by Felix Carbonnell, the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MINC MINC] tools and the [http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/users/yaddab/Yasser-HBM2006-Poster.pdf CIVET] pipeline. 
*The pipeline system is a project called [http://code.google.com/p/psom/ PSOM] developed by Pierre Bellec (MIT license). PSOM is not part of the NIAK code base, but is bundled as part of the NIAK archive. 
*The NIFTI reader/writer is adapted from a [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=8797&objectType=file code] by [http://www.rotman-baycrest.on.ca/~jimmy/ Jimmy Shen] (BSD license). 
*The [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/956 conversion] between rotation/translation and matrix representations of rigid-body motion by Giampiero Campa (BSD license). 
*The 'sinc' scheme for slice timing correction is a port from [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ SPM] (GPL license). 
*The NIAK logo was adapted from an original work by the artist [mattahan.deviantart.com/ Mattahan] (creative commons license). 
*The spatial independent component analysis was extracted from [http://sccn.ucsd.edu/fmrlab/ fMRlab] (GPL license). 
*The windowed Fourier transfrom is from the [http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~wavelab/ WaveLab] toolbox (license&nbsp;: non-standard). 
*The mutli-dimensional scaling algorithm and implementation was generously contributed by [http://pgrc-16.ipk-gatersleben.de/~stricker/ Marc Strickert] as part of the NIAK project (MIT license).
*The brain connectivity toolbox https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/ is not part of the NIAK code base, but is bundled as part of the NIAK archive.
