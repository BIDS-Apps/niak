You can find the full descrition of the [NIAK fmri preprocessing pipeline here.](http://niak.simexp-lab.org/pipe_preprocessing.html)

This pipeline first aim at reducing various artefacts that compromise the interpretation of fMRI fluctuations, e.g. physiological and motion artefacts. The second major aim is to align the data acquired at different points in time for a single subject, sometimes separated by years, and also to establish some correspondance between the brains of different subjects, such that an inference on the role of a given brain area can be carried at the level of a group.

# Niak
The neuroimaging analysis kit (NIAK) is a library of functions for the preprocessing and mining of large functional neuroimaging data, using GNU Octave or Matlab(r), and distributed under a MIT license. 

Essential documentation can be found on the [NIAK website](http://niak.simexp-lab.org/). 

## How to report errors and ask questions

If the problems seems to be related to the app itself, you can always create a [new issue on or github page.](https://github.com/BIDS-Apps/niak/issues)  
If is seems to come from NIAK itself, please [report you issues on the NIAK github page](https://github.com/SIMEXP/niak/issues)
