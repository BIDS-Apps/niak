opt_g.min_nb_vol = 100;     % the minimum number of volumes for an fmri dataset to be included. this option is useful when scrubbing is used, and the resulting time series may be too short.
opt_g.min_xcorr_func = 0.5; % the minimum xcorr score for an fmri dataset to be included. this metric is a tool for quality control which assess the quality of non-linear coregistration of functional images in stereotaxic space. manual inspection of the values during qc is necessary to properly set this threshold.
opt_g.min_xcorr_anat = 0.5; % the minimum xcorr score for an fmri dataset to be included. this metric is a tool for quality control which assess the quality of non-linear coregistration of the anatomical image in stereotaxic space. manual inspection of the values during qc is necessary to properly set this threshold.
opt_g.exclude_subject = {'subject1','subject2'}; % if for whatever reason some subjects have to be excluded that were not caught by the quality control metrics, it is possible to manually specify their ids here.
opt_g.type_files = 'rest'; % specify to the grabber to prepare the files for the stability_rest pipeline

%% !! alternative method
%% grab the results of the region growing pipeline.
%% if the region growing pipeline has already been executed on this database, it is possible to start right out from its outputs.
%% to use this alternative method, uncomment the following line and suppress the block of code above ("grabbing the results from the niak fmri preprocessing pipeline")
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% files_in = niak_grab_region_growing('/home/toto/database/region_growing');

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% extra infos
%% these have to be organized in a comma-separated file (csv). example:
%%          , sex
%% subject1 , 0
%% subject2 , 1
%%
%% note that the first entry has to be left empty. the subject ids need to be identical to those used in the fmri preprocessing pipeline.
%% also, only numerical variables are supported (i.e. no 'm', 'w' to code for man and woman).
%% these variables will be used to split the subjects into strata, e.g. men vs women. in the group analysis, equal weight is given to all strata
%% (regardless of the number of subjects). resampling of subjects is also made within strata, but not between them. adding more covariates
%% will further stratify the group sample (e.g. two variables old/young men/women will translate into 4 strata).
%%
%% if you want to stratify the sample, uncomment the following line and indicate the csv file you want to use. otherwise, just leave it as is.
%% to check that the file is properly formatted prior to running the pipeline, run the following command in matlab/octave:
%% [tab,labx,laby] = niak_read_csv('/data/infos.csv');
%% the subject ids should load in labx, the covariate ids load in laby, and the value of the variables into a numerical array tab.
